# First react project made by myself

Html and css were copied because this was not my learning-focus, the react part was 100% done as a way to challenge myself.

Initially the project didnt had some features so i added them:
 - Context
 - Reduce
 - Immer

To test the project, write in the terminal:
```js
npm i
npm run dev
```
and open [this tab](http://localhost:3000/).
